# hello-world
Hi, my name's Joshua. I'm 15 years old, and I've been a huge fan of fighting games since I was 11 (playing games since I was 3). I'm a huge fan and an aspiring professional player in an FG title popularly known as "Brawlhalla." My friends say that I'm a great person, although I beg to differ.
